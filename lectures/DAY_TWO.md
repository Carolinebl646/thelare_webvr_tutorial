## Start - 15 minutes - Danny house rules
  - stay within kitchen
  - reminder where restrooms are
  - pair programming (we're going to be working in pairs, one person is on keyboard, the other is giving suggestions and actively listening/talking)
  - reminders: ask QUESTIONS, what are pomodoros again?
  - loter√≠a, Danny will pull out and define 3 terms right after the start of each session
  - between each session coaches should get on the same page about pacing (Sai is ahead of me 0_0)

## Session 2 - Introduce Javascript and embedding files
  - should bleed over a bit
  - walk them through the example branch
  - setup javascript/style linter on your own files, students will need this (atom, install package, etc) (maybe teach command shift p, out of scope)
  - students should display an image via google's api before moving forward.
  - you're going to have to show them the console as a debugging tool (only console, don't go deep into everything else)

## Session 3 - Introduce Google Cardboard
  - bleed over from above ^^
  - [youtube: how it works!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxAj2lyX4oU)
  - ask students to write down the differences they noticed (2014 v. 2015, biggest ones is magnet, and probably sticker, not a lot of other things, just to get some excited

## Session 4 - Introduce local server (Simple Python for local)
 Walk students through this process (they will not understand)
 - download ngrok (https://ngrok.com/)
 - move ngrok to directory (do this manually via ui, drag/drop)
 - go to command line, type in ngrok http 8000 (python server port)
 - tell students to pull out there phone and look at their own sites
 - change the picture

## Session 5 - What makes a good photo?
  - monoscopic versus stereoscopic (define each prefix and the -scopic suffix), ask what they think it means
  - talk about aspect ratio (2:1)[Image specification](https://developers.google.com/vr/concepts/vrview#image_specifications)
  - you want 'equirectangular photos' with an aspect ratio of 2:1
  - find photos online, go through process of cropping and getting the correct aspect ratio

## Session 6 - Story-telling via pairs
* look for (VR examples)[https://www.webvrexperiments.com/]
